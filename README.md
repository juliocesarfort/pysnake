# A simple snake game
A simple snake game to get a bit more acquainted with pygame and
2D game development with Python. Hopefully this will be the first of a
couple of more games.

WHAT HAS DONE SO FAR:
* Moving the head of the snake around with a smooth movement
* Collision detection in the borders of the canvas

TODO:
* Implement eat_apple()
* Make the snake follow the growth rules
* Improve the collision detection mechanism

Beerware? WTFPL? It's just a toy code to practice some Python, really, so
I could care less.
